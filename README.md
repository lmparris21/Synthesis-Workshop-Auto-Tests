Synthesis Workshop Problem Sets Automated Tests
by Landon Parris

For this project I created tests to check the functionality of the Problem Sets Page, header, and footer on the Synthesis Workshop Website at http://synthesis-workshop.com.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com/
I used Playwright and JavaScript to write the test scripts which can be ran with Playwright installed using the command npx playwright test.

verifies the file is downloaded, and asserts the name of the file is correct.
